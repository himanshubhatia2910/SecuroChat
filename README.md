## Aim
To prevent spreading of malicious activities over chatting applications.
## Motivation
The primary motivation behind trying to implement this project was an incident that happend in Delhi,India 23rd February 2020
‚ÄúKattar Hindu Ekta‚Äù WhatsApp Group where violence against Non-Hindu communities was spread.We thought a monitoring system would be a crucial tool in order to prevent such malicious activities.

## Overview of the Project
The project is essentially a proof of concept for chat monitoring systems which can be deployed by the authoritarian bodies to prevent spreading of hate speech and avoid possible violent outcomes.We have divided the project in two apps:
- **SecuroChat:** This is the app where users can communicate with each other through textual messages which will be checked at real-time when user is typing and won't allow to send hate/racist messages.SecuroChat is made to simulate a chat application which can be a medium to send inappropriate messages.If a user tries to send a hate messages,their details like physical cordinates(Location) along with the copy of the message.This can be used to investigate the source of hate information and catch hold of people behind it.

- **AdminHub:** This app is used to set keywords that will be checked,both apps are connected to the same real-time database and throughthis app the admin can also send warning mail to users.
